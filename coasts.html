        <h5>Portland Head Light is, somewhat ironically, not in Portland. It's in a town nearby called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Portland+Head+Lighthouse/@43.623056,-70.2101047,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cb29e051cbaa6f5:0xb050b9cf68d7f03f!8m2!3d43.623056!4d-70.207916">Cape Elizabeth.</a></h5>
        
<p>The ocean is probably the first thing people think of when they think of Maine. It does has a lot of coastline. About 230 miles of coast. This is something you might brag about to people from New Hampshire.</p>
<p>There are beaches everywhere, of course. The "midcoast" region about halfway up the state's coast is probably the most scenic. Towns like Phippsburg, Camden, and then Bar Harbor in Acadia National Park would be my recommendations.</p>
<p>Many of Maine's beaches are state parks or other conserved areas. This is what keeps them pristine.</p>
