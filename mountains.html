<h5><em>Mt. Katahdin (Maine), Autumn #2</em> by Marsden Hartley, Maine artist.</h5>
    
<p>Mountains are a big deal in Maine. It's a major hiking destination for the East Coast since mountains over here are, in general, a little diminutive. The west coast wins on that front, I'll admit.</p>
<p>But hiking Katahdin (painted above) is great. It's the highest point in the state, and the terminus (or starting point, depending on what direction you're going) of the <a href="http://www.appalachiantrail.org/">Appalachian Trail.</a></p>
<p>Most good hiking in Maine is in the west and central parts of the state. But there are even some foothills you can explore on the coast. That way you get mountains and oceans. Pretty neat.</p>
    
<p>Of course skiing is huge, too. Both downhill and cross-country.</p>
