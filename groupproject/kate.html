                    <p>Ditmas Park is neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY bounded by Dorchester Road, Ocean Avenue, Newkirk Avenue and E.16th Steet. The Ditmas Park Association cites that the area used to be farm land owned by the Van Ditmasen family who built their first home approximately in 1965. In 1981, Ditmas Park was designated a historic district.</p>

                <h1 class="h1_kate">Victorian Charm</h1>
                    <p>The area remained largely rural until the turn of the century. Homes ranged in architecture styles from bungalows with low hanging roofs to Queen Annes with sprawling front porches.</p>

                 <h1 class="h1_kate">Brooklyn Comfort</h1>
                    <p>Today, the neighboorhood is still known for massive homes with Victorian charm and wrap around porches. The overall effect is quite welcoming and at the same time, unattainable. According to <a href="http://streeteasy.com/area/ditmas-park" target="_blank">StreetEasy</a>, the century old homes sell for over a million dollars. The historic neighborhood is small and residents flock to Cortelyou Road for dining and entertainment. Ditmas Park is ideal for someone who yearns for a quieter way of life but isn't quite ready to give up on the city. The subway is easily accessed via Newkirk Plaza where residents have the B (express, weekday) and Q (local) lines. And if you're in the neighborhood, stop by <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/coffee-mob-new-york" target="_blank">Coffee Mob</a> right off the train and slowly stroll the tree lines streets. You don't have to rush, you're not in Manhattan!</p>
